## Word Cloud Executive Summary

This project creates a Word Cloud in realtime for any text or paragraph entered in the input text area. 

The user can also copy and paste the transcript of entire speeches, news articles, book contents etc, to get a feel of the most common words used. 

The Word Cloud gets updated in realtime as and when the user enters or modifies the text.

### Cool Factor

* It is really fun to visually see the Word Cloud changing in realtime based on the text or some article or speeches.
* This application could also be used to get some sentiment analysis. For example, by analyzing the transcript of a person's speech, we could get some insights at the language used, theme spoken etc.
